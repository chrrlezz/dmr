Contains my DMR code plugs 

DMR (Digital Moble Radio) is a commercial digital two-way radio standard that has been adopted for amateur radio use.

A codeplug is DMR speak for a configuration file used to program a DMR radio to work on a DMR radio network.

My inital codeplug is for the PRN DMR Network that covers North and South Carolina and parts of Virgina

The cs750_PRN.rb codeplug file is for the Connect Systems CS750 DMR portable radio. It is based on the SCHEART (South Carolina Hospital Emergence Amateur Radio Team) codeplug with some PRN Network Repeaters added. Also I added Durham area and Carteret County 70cm analog repeaters to a zone named Analog.
