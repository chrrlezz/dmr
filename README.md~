DMR (Digital Moble Radio) is a commercial digital two-way radio standard that has been adopted for amatuer radio use.

A codeplug is DMR speak for a configuration file used to program a DMR radio to work on a DMR radio network.

My inital codeplug is for the PRN DMR Network that covers North and South Carolina and parts of Virgina
